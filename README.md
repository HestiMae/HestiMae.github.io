# Hestia Mae Heartstrings

Hi there! If you're reading this, you're for some reason interested in the things I've done before, and the things I might like to do in future. 

## Before

I'm a Software Engineering / Pure Maths graduate, so I've ended up making a few projects through that.

One of those was a [strange TUI/CLI game made in Java](https://github.com/HestiMae/rogue-bizarre-adventure) which, over time, had it's scope run away into including many advanced features.

I've also done full-stack development in CakePHP for a simple travel booking website, with user login and payment integration. (Can't show this one!)

I've also worked as a Software Engineer, working especially around Data Manipulation and Web Apps. 

In one instance, I co-developed a data entry/manipulation/autofill Node.js app called *Silver*

This was packaged as an Word/Excel (online and offline) Office.JS add-in, which let users import data from a web service, and helped them file word-document reports by autofilling fields and providing an information summary for fields which couldn't be filled automatically.

The most notable part of the app was that it was data-driven - All of the specification for retrieving and manipulating data for each field from the CSV could be configured in JSON using string-specified binary and reducer operators.

I enjoy working in collaborative and open source communities in my free time. Most recently I worked on a large PR for a [mod](https://modrinth.com/mod/switchy) for _Minecraft_ that implemented a graphical frontend to the otherwise CLI-only mod.

As someone familiar with full stack development in web, the end result is visually simplistic - but it's intuitive and fits within the style and quite strict technical limitations imposed by the game and modding tools.

I found this project very interesting to work on and collaborate with the API developer around - _Minecraft_ operates with a familiar structure of "Client" and "Server", where this interface operates purely on the "Client", while the mod itself and all data is held purely on the "Server" - bringing limitations i'm all too familiar with from standard frontend development, but boiled down to bare essentials.

## Later

I'm interested in pursuing projects that challenge my software engineering skills, as well as encourage opportunities to learn more in mathematics. I like working on things that feel like real solutions to problems - that some end user will eventually enjoy - not just the five-thousandth copy of a bespoke enterprise solution.
