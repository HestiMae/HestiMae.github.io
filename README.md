# Hestia Mae Heartstrings

Hi there! If you're reading this, you're for some reason interested in the things I've done before, and the thing I might like to do in future. 

## Before

I'm a Software Engineering / Pure Maths graduate, so I've ended up making a few projects through that.

One of those was a [strange TUI/CLI game made in Java](https://github.com/HestiMae/rogue-bizarre-adventure) which, over time, had it's scope run away into including many advanced features.

I've also done full-stack development in CakePHP for a simple travel booking website, with user login and payment integration. (Can't show this one!)

I've also worked as a Software Engineer, working especially around Data Manipulation and Web Apps. 

In one instance, I co-developed a data entry/manipulation/autofill Node.js app called *Silver*

This was packaged as an Word/Excel (online and offline) Office.JS add-in, which let users import data from a web service, and helped them file word-document reports by autofilling fields and providing an information summary for fields which couldn't be filled automatically.

The most notable part of the app was that it was data-driven - All of the specification for retrieving and manipulating data for each field from the CSV could be configured in JSON using string-specified binary and reducer operators.

## Later

I'm interested in pursuing projects that challenge my software engineering skills, as well as encourage opportunities to learn more in mathematics. I like working on things that feel like real solutions to problems - not just the five-thousandth "Bespoke Enterprise IT Solution" that could've been an open-source project years ago.
